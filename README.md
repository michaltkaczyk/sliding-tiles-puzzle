# Sliding tiles puzzle

This is an implementation of the search algorithm for solving a sliding tiles puzzle based on 
the "An Introduction to Machine Learning" book by Miroslav Kubat. It is meant to be a Python 
practice mostly.

## To-do's:

- (nothing for now)
 
## Ideas for the future:

- Calculate the number of steps required to solve the board on average (or for particular cases) 
  and compare that against other known algorithms.
- Given a completely random permutation (one that would come out of "breaking the third 
  dimension", and re-assembling the puzzle, rather than just legally moving the tiles across the 
  board), what is the chance of the puzzle being solvable?
